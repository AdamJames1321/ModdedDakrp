	"info" "This is a replacement scoreboard for DarkRP for those who don't like using FAdmin and wish to remove it. It's actually the scoreboard from before FAdmin was added, I just ported it over to GMod 13. To remove FAdmin, you should first delete the file darkrp/gamemode/shared/FAdmin_DarkRP.lua, then install this addon on your server.
